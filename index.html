    <h1>Privacy Policy for SkyCrafter Application</h1>
    <div>
        <p><strong>Effective Date: April 18, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the practices regarding the collection, use, and protection of personal data and information for the "Hypixel Crafting Tracker" mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "App"). This policy is intended to provide transparency and inform users about how their information is handled.</p>

        <h3>1. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
        <p>The App is designed as a personal resource management tool for tracking in-game items within the Hypixel Skyblock game. We do not collect any personal data from users. Specifically, the following types of data are not collected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or locations.</li>
            <li>Usage data related to interactions with the App, such as tracked items or usage frequency.</li>
            <li>Device-specific information such as device models, operating systems, or unique device identifiers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The App operates entirely offline on the user's device. All data entered into the App, such as the names and quantities of resources being tracked, is stored locally on the device's internal storage. This data is neither accessible to us nor transmitted to any external servers or third-party systems.</p>

        <h3>2. Data Sharing with Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We do not share any user data with third parties. As the App does not collect personal data, there is no information to share.</p>

        <h3>3. Advertising</h3>
        <p>The App does not include any advertisements. We are committed to providing a user experience free from third-party promotional content.</p>

        <h3>4. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>The App is intended for use by game enthusiasts and is not specifically targeted toward children under the age of 13. As no personal data is collected, the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar international regulations regarding the collection of children's personal information do not apply to this App.</p>

        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>As all data is stored locally on the user's device and we do not have access to this data, the security of the information is primarily dependent on the security measures implemented by the user. We recommend taking appropriate steps to secure your device, such as using strong passwords or biometric authentication.</p>

        <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in the App's functionality or to comply with legal requirements. Any updates will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy within the App. Users are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>7. Contact Information</h3>
