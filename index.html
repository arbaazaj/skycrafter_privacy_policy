    <h1>Privacy Policy for Hypixel Crafting Tracker Application</h1>
    <div>
        <b>>Effective Date: April 18, 2025</b>

This Privacy Policy outlines the practices concerning personal data and information for the "Hypixel Crafting Tracker" mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "App"). This policy is intended to inform you, as a user of the App, about how your information is handled.

<h3>1. Data Collection and Usage:</h3>

The App is designed as a personal resource management tool for tracking in-game items within the Hypixel Skyblock game. We do not collect any personal data from you. This includes, but is not limited to:

Personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or location.
Usage data related to your interaction with the App, such as the items you track or the frequency of your usage.
Device-specific information such as your device model, operating system, or unique device identifiers.
The App functions entirely offline on your device. The data you input into the App, such as the names and quantities of resources you are tracking, is stored locally on your device's internal storage. We do not have access to this data, nor is it transmitted to our servers or any third-party systems.

2. Data Sharing with Third Parties:

We do not share any user data with third parties. As stated above, the App does not collect any personal data, and therefore, there is no data to share.

3. Advertising:

The App does not contain any advertisements. We are committed to providing a user experience free from third-party promotional content.

4. Children's Privacy:

The App is a tool for game enthusiasts and is not specifically targeted towards children under the age of 13. However, given that we do not collect any personal data, the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar international regulations regarding the collection of children's personal information do not apply to this App.

5. Data Security:

As the App stores all data locally on your device and we do not have access to this data, the security of your information is primarily dependent on the security measures you have implemented on your own device. We recommend that you take appropriate steps to secure your device, such as using strong passwords or biometric authentication.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy:

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App's functionality or legal requirements. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy within the App. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.   

7. Contact Us:

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us. As we do not collect personal data, your inquiries should generally be related to the functionality and intended use of the App.
